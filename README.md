# Inferential-Statistics
Statistical Reference is the process of using data analysis to deduce the properties of an underlying probability distribution.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

The conclusion of a statistical inference is a statistical proposition.Some common proppositions:

1. a point estimate, i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest;
2. an interval estimate, e.g. a confidence interval (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the probability at the stated confidence level;
3. a credible interval, i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;
4. rejection of a hypothesis;[a]
5. clustering or classification of data points into groups.

From Coursera: 

Inferential statistics are concerned with making inferences based on relations found in the sample, to relations in the population. Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.

We will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. 

For those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisherâ€™s exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).
